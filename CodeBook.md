1. Introduction to the project and initial datasets.
----------------------------------------------------

Accordingly, to the task, this project deals with datasets from:

Jorge L. Reyes-Ortiz, Davide Anguita, Alessandro Ghio, Luca Oneto. Smartlab - Non Linear Complex Systems Laboratory Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset Version 1.0

More detailed description available from a readme.txt file in ./UCI HAR Dataset folder which contains all downloaded original files and information.

2. Data folder and datasets for each step of task.
--------------------------------------------------

Data as csv files are stored after each step of analysis automatically to ./data folder. You can check results of each steps in those files: ./task\_1\_dataset.csv ./task\_2\_dataset.csv ./task\_3\_dataset.csv ./task\_4\_dataset.csv

Also, results of final task were stored as an addiional csv file. ./task\_5\_final\_dataset.csv

3. Final dataset.
-----------------

After all tasks completed script writes result dataset to task\_5\_final\_dataset.txt which is in the root folder of the project.

Also, you can find there all required additional files: run\_analysis.R README.md CodeBook.md

Final dataset includes the following columnt names: "subject\_test" "exercise\_mode" "tbodyacc\_mean\_x" "tbodyacc\_mean\_y" "tbodyacc\_mean\_z" "tgravityacc\_mean\_x" "tgravityacc\_mean\_y" "tgravityacc\_mean\_z" "tbodyaccjerk\_mean\_x" "tbodyaccjerk\_mean\_y" "tbodyaccjerk\_mean\_z" "tbodygyro\_mean\_x" "tbodygyro\_mean\_y" "tbodygyro\_mean\_z" "tbodygyrojerk\_mean\_x" "tbodygyrojerk\_mean\_y" "tbodygyrojerk\_mean\_z" "tbodyaccmag\_mean" "tgravityaccmag\_mean" "tbodyaccjerkmag\_mean" "tbodygyromag\_mean" "tbodygyrojerkmag\_mean" "fbodyacc\_mean\_x" "fbodyacc\_mean\_y" "fbodyacc\_mean\_z" "fbodyacc\_meanfreq\_x" "fbodyacc\_meanfreq\_y" "fbodyacc\_meanfreq\_z" "fbodyaccjerk\_mean\_x" "fbodyaccjerk\_mean\_y" "fbodyaccjerk\_mean\_z" "fbodyaccjerk\_meanfreq\_x" "fbodyaccjerk\_meanfreq\_y" "fbodyaccjerk\_meanfreq\_z" "fbodygyro\_mean\_x" "fbodygyro\_mean\_y" "fbodygyro\_mean\_z" "fbodygyro\_meanfreq\_x" "fbodygyro\_meanfreq\_y" "fbodygyro\_meanfreq\_z" "fbodyaccmag\_mean" "fbodyaccmag\_meanfreq" "fbodybodyaccjerkmag\_mean" "fbodybodyaccjerkmag\_meanfreq" "fbodybodygyromag\_mean" "fbodybodygyromag\_meanfreq" "fbodybodygyrojerkmag\_mean" "fbodybodygyrojerkmag\_meanfreq" "angle\_tbodyaccmean\_gravity" "angle\_tbodyaccjerkmean\_gravitymean" "angle\_tbodygyromean\_gravitymean" "angle\_tbodygyrojerkmean\_gravitymean" "angle\_x\_gravitymean" "angle\_y\_gravitymean" "angle\_z\_gravitymean" "tbodyacc\_std\_x" "tbodyacc\_std\_y" "tbodyacc\_std\_z" "tgravityacc\_std\_x" "tgravityacc\_std\_y" "tgravityacc\_std\_z" "tbodyaccjerk\_std\_x" "tbodyaccjerk\_std\_y" "tbodyaccjerk\_std\_z" "tbodygyro\_std\_x" "tbodygyro\_std\_y" "tbodygyro\_std\_z" "tbodygyrojerk\_std\_x" "tbodygyrojerk\_std\_y" "tbodygyrojerk\_std\_z" "tbodyaccmag\_std" "tgravityaccmag\_std" "tbodyaccjerkmag\_std" "tbodygyromag\_std" "tbodygyrojerkmag\_std" "fbodyacc\_std\_x" "fbodyacc\_std\_y" "fbodyacc\_std\_z" "fbodyaccjerk\_std\_x" "fbodyaccjerk\_std\_y" "fbodyaccjerk\_std\_z" "fbodygyro\_std\_x" "fbodygyro\_std\_y" "fbodygyro\_std\_z" "fbodyaccmag\_std" "fbodybodyaccjerkmag\_std" "fbodybodygyromag\_std" "fbodybodygyrojerkmag\_std"

You can see that all column names were corrected during the transformation of the dataset.
